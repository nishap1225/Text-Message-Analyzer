        <p class="author">July 2020
          <br>Reena Yuan and Nisha Prabhakar</p>

        <p class="body-text">This summer, we used our text messages as our dataset and Google's pretrained NLP model BERT
        to help us analyze our data in several different ways. We started off by using BERT embeddings and scikit-learn
        in order to classify our text messages by author. Then, we used T-SNE to visualize the embeddings and see how our
        conversations were affected by COVID-19. </p>

        <p class="body-text">
          We wanted to see how accurate BERT embeddings, specifically for whole sentences, were by seeing how accurately it
          could be used to classify text messages. We did this by using the vector embeddings to train a logistic regression model.

        <p class="body-text">
          We used transformers in order to use the DistilBert model, as well as several libraries including Pytorch, numpy, scikit and pandas.
